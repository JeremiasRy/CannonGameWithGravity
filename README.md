Sadly it doesn't respond really good on windows 11 for some reason. I have not yet dwelved into trying to get it more compatible with different machines than mine.
It's .net console game where you can shoot with your tank! I tried to build some sort of physics engine and got some good results. <br/>
Recoils from ground and sides were easy to make happen and act naturally but I ran into some issues when trying to make other objects collide with each other. <br/>
It ended up feeling like I was just trying to script my way through problems and not actually programming. I guess I'll have to work out physics next... <br/>

To run this game you'll need visual studio, just git clone the repository and dotnet run on terminal or just click the green play button!

## Controls
